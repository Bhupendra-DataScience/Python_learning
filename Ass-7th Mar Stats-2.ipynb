If the standard deviation was high, it would indicate that there is a wide range of heights among the students."

    "Answer- Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution. In statistics, a distribution is said to be skewed if it is not symmetric. This means that the distribution has more data points on one side of the center than on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the distribution has a longer tail on the left-hand side, it is said to be left-skewed or negatively skewed. If the distribution has a longer tail on the right-hand side, it is said to be right-skewed or positively skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness can have an impact on the mean, median, and mode of a distribution. In a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, and the mode is greater than the median. In a right-skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, and the mode is less than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is an important aspect of data analysis because it can affect the interpretation of statistical results. In particular, skewed data can lead to biased estimates of central tendency and dispersion. Therefore, it is important to examine the skewness of data before applying statistical methods that assume normality."

    "\n",
    "- Units of measurement: Covariance is measured in the units of the variables being studied, while correlation is a unitless measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scale: Covariance can take on any value between negative infinity and positive infinity, while correlation is always between -1 and +1.\n",

    "- Strength of relationship: Covariance only tells us whether two variables have a positive or negative relationship, while correlation tells us both the direction and the strength of the relationship.\n",

    "Answer- Outliers are extreme values that lie far away from the other values in a dataset. Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion, such as the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For measures of central tendency, outliers can skew the data and affect the location of the center point of the distribution. This is because measures of central tendency are sensitive to extreme values, such as outliers. The mean is particularly sensitive to outliers because it takes into account every value in the dataset. The median and mode are less sensitive to outliers because they only consider the middle or most frequent values in the dataset, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For measures of dispersion, outliers can affect the spread or variability of the data. Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation of the data, which means that the data is more spread out than it would be without the outliers.\n",

    "Question 1- Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that define a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects can perform. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that has specific values for its attributes and can invoke the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a class called \"Calculation\" that doing sum and division & here c1 and c2 are two class object.\n"

    "Question 2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: It is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world and exposing only the necessary information through methods. This helps to achieve data security, maintainability, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: It is a mechanism by which a new class is created from an existing class, inheriting the properties and behaviors of the parent class. This helps to reuse code, reduce code redundancy, and organize code into a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take on many forms, depending on the context in which it is used. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading, method overriding, and interfaces, and it helps to write flexible and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: It is the process of focusing on essential features of an object and ignoring the irrelevant details. Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, and it helps to reduce complexity, increase efficiency, and maintain the code."

    "Question 3- Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- In object-oriented programming, the __init__() function is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes with the values provided during object creation, and it can also perform any other necessary setup or initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() method is useful because it allows us to ensure that every object created from the class has the necessary attributes and initial values, which can help avoid errors and make the code more maintainable.\n",

    "Question 4- Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer- self is not a keyword, it is for refrence the class objects.  We can say that the self keyword is used to refer to the current instance of a class, which is the object that is being created or operated on. The self keyword is used as the first parameter in most instance methods of a class, including the __init__() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the self keyword is important because it allows us to access and manipulate the object's attributes and methods within the class. When a method is called on an object, the object itself is automatically passed as the first argument to the method, which is referred to as self.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use self-defined keyword insted of self. The only thing is there we have to provide atleast one keyword in defining class.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that don't use the traditional relational database model based on tables, rows, and columns. Instead, they store data in flexible and schema-less formats such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, which makes them suitable for modern web applications that need to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data has a semi-structured or unstructured format, such as social media data, IoT data, or logs.\n",

    "The application needs to support geospatial queries, as MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial indexes and queries.\n",

    "Answer- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers a number of features that make it an attractive choice for modern web applications. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents that can contain nested sub-documents and arrays. This makes it easy to represent complex relationships between data objects and avoids the need to define rigid schemas upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema-Free: MongoDB doesn't enforce any predefined schema for the documents stored in it. This means that you can easily add, remove or modify fields in the documents as needed, without having to modify the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High Performance: MongoDB is designed to deliver high performance in both read and write operations. It uses memory-mapped files to keep frequently accessed data in memory, and supports indexing for efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple servers, which makes it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports rich and complex queries on both individual documents and collections of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a flexible and powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data analysis and aggregation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Automatic Sharding: MongoDB provides automatic sharding, which allows you to partition data across multiple servers and scale horizontally with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Replication and Fault Tolerance: MongoDB provides replication and fault tolerance features that ensure high availability and data durability even in the event of hardware failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB offers a rich set of features that make it an attractive choice for modern web applications. Its document-oriented approach, schema-free design, high performance, horizontal scalability, rich query language, and fault tolerance features make it a powerful database solution for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads"

    "Answer- A database is a collection of organized data that is stored and managed in a computer system. Databases are used to store and retrieve large amounts of information quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases that are commonly used in modern software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model, and they store data in tables with rows and columns. SQL databases use SQL as their primary language for managing and querying data. They are typically used for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial systems or enterprise software.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use non-relational data models, and they store data in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, making them ideal for applications that require high performance and the ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use non-relational data models.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as their primary language for managing and querying data, while NoSQL databases use different query languages, such as JSON or JavaScript.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and can handle large volumes of unstructured data, while SQL databases are typically less scalable and may require additional hardware to handle large volumes of data."

    "Answer - Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in database design, and they are used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify each row in a table. The primary key ensures that there are no duplicate records in the table and provides a means of quickly and efficiently identifying and accessing individual records. For example, in a \"students\" table, the \"student_id\" column can be used as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables in a database. The foreign key ensures that the data in the related tables remains consistent, and that any changes made to the primary key are reflected in the related tables. For example, in a \"student_courses\" table, the \"student_id\" column can be used as a foreign key to reference the \"student_id\" column in the \"students\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the concept of primary key and foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two tables: \"students\" and \"enrollments\". The \"students\" table has columns for student_id (primary key), first_name, and last_name. The \"enrollments\" table has columns for enrollment_id (primary key), student_id (foreign key), course_name, and course_code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"student_id\" column in the \"students\" table is the primary key, and the \"student_id\" column in the \"enrollments\" table is the foreign key. The foreign key ensures that each record in the \"enrollments\" table corresponds to a valid record in the \"students\" table. If a record is deleted from the \"students\" table, the foreign key constraint ensures that all related records in the \"enrollments\" table are also deleted to maintain referential integrity.\n",
